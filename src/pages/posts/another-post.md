What a beautiful face\
I have found in this place\
That is circling all 'round the sun\
What a beautiful dream\
That could flash on the screen\
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me\
Soft and sweet\
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me

And one day we will die\
And our ashes will fly from the aeroplane over the sea\
But for now we are young\
Let us lay in the sun\
And count every beautiful thing we can see\
Love to be\
In the arms of all I'm keepin' here with me

What a curious life\
They have found here tonight\
There is music, there is sounds from the street\
There are lights in the clouds\
Anna's ghost all around\
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me\
Soft and sweet\
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

Now how I remember you\
How I would push my fingers through\
Your mouth to make those muscles move\
That made your voice so smooth and sweet

And now we keep where we don't know\
All secrets sleep in winter clothes\
With one you loved so long ago\
Now he don't even know his name

What a beautiful face\
I have found in this place\
That is circling all 'round the sun\
And when we meet on a cloud\
I'll be laughing out loud\
I'll be laughing with everyone I see\
Can't believe how strange it is to be anything at all
